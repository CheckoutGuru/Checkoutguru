# Check Out Guru — Static Shopee Affiliate Site

A minimal static starter site to promote Shopee products with manual affiliate links.

## Files

- `index.html` — Main page with product cards.
- `styles.css` — Simple red-themed styling.

## Quick start

Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.

To add products:
1. Replace the sample `href` values in each product card with your Shopee affiliate URLs.
2. Optionally append UTM params for tracking, e.g. `?utm_source=check-out-guru&utm_medium=affiliate`.

## Deploy

You can deploy this folder to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages). No server required.

## Next steps

- Add more product cards and images.
- Add Google Analytics / simple click tracking.
- Create category pages or a simple search filter.
